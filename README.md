# dustfiles

Contains the original Fortran files for Wiscombe's Mie scattering algorithms**, and a Python translation of the ErrPack and MIEV0noP files (the MIEV0 Python file is incomplete, just there for reference - use MIEV0noP).
Also contains Draine's dust data tables, and iPython notebook files plotting Mie and Draine values.

**Only edits made to the original files are print statements, to be used as checkpoints for debugging
