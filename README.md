# dustfiles #

Contains the original Fortran files for Wiscombe's Mie scattering algorithms**, and a Python translation of the ErrPack and MIEV0noP files.
Also contains Draine's dust data tables, and iPython notebook files plotting Mie and Draine values.

**Only edits made to the original files are print statements, to be used as checkpoints for debugging

Print checkpoints are not necessarily supposed to all show up or appear in the correct order; they are more like tags that indicate where you are in the code when it's running.

Notes
-----
The MIEV0 file is included just in case, since a lot of it has already been translated to Python - however, it is definitely incomplete and needs a fair amount of editing/testing before it's usable.
